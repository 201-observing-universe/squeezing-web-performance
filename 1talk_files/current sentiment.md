we try to ship more features
we neglect performance in the meantime
we should focus on core features and delivering them perfectly, which implies performance
big companies are thinking about performance and gaining results in users growth and retention
some success
though I can say performance is not that important for really important websites, like government websites, which users will still use as there're no alternative. Thou they won't be happy, tho they will use still.
