# network connections and mobile power

it's all about your user base. If you target only your city and you have very good internet then thinking about slow connections doesn't make much sense. If you want to grow in areas of the world with slow connections then it very much makes a lot of sense.

performance is the real factor thou. If internet is not something you can drastically improve with money, it usually greatly depends on the condition of your coutry/city. Phones are slightly different story. Current year Flagman devices are much more performant than their outdated or cheap counterparts.

So less js depends and less rendering load is probably universal conclusion makes sense here.
